Adds `DataGrid`, a virtualized alternative to `Table` for datasets too large to mount all at once — only the rows scrolled into view are ever rendered, so a grid with thousands of rows costs the same to render as one with a dozen. Composed the same way as `Table` (`DataGridHeader`/`DataGridColumn`/`DataGridBody`/`DataGridRow`/`DataGridCell`), plus `DataGridSelectAllCell`/`DataGridSelectionCell` for selection checkboxes.

Beyond basic virtualized rows, columns, sorting, and selection, it also supports:

- **Pinned columns** — `pin="start"`/`pin="end"` on a `DataGridColumn` keeps it visible while the grid scrolls horizontally, with multiple pinned columns on the same side stacking in declaration order.
- **Variable row height** — `rowHeight="auto"` (paired with `estimatedRowHeight`) measures each row from its own rendered content instead of a single fixed height shared by every row.
- **Async/infinite loading** — `onLoadMore`/`isLoading`/`loadingContent` on `DataGridBody` fetch and append more rows as the grid scrolls near its last one, for datasets too large to load up front.
- **Header/footer pinning** — the header row stays pinned to the top of the grid's scrollable area as body rows scroll underneath it; a new `footer` prop on `DataGrid` renders content (e.g. a totals row) pinned below the body, outside the grid's own keyboard-navigable structure.

This adds `react-aria-components` as a runtime dependency — `DataGrid` is built on its `Virtualizer`, and it's the only component in the package that uses it. It's externalized from the bundle, so it resolves from your own `node_modules` like `react-aria` already does. Note that `react-aria-components` pins `react-aria` to an exact version, so an install may end up with a second copy of `react-aria` alongside the one this package depends on; nothing here relies on the two being the same instance.

See the `datagrid.mdx` docs page for the full set of examples and documented scope boundaries (e.g. no stacked variant, no zebra striping, no interactive column resize/reorder — all deliberate given the virtualized rendering model).
